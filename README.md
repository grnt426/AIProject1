Hitori Solver
=============

The first AI Project is to create a solver for a game of Hitori. A brute-force
solver and a more intelligent one are created to compare the difference.

Rules of Hitori
---------------
Rule One: When solved, the same number does not appear twice (White)
			in any single row or column.
Rule Two: No two Black squares are horizontally or vertically adjacent
            (diagonal is OK).
Rule Three: All of the White squares form a single
            (horizontally and/or vertically) connected group.

Dependencies
------------
* Python 3.2
